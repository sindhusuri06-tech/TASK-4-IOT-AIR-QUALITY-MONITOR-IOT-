# Task 4: IoT Air Quality Monitor

## Objective
To design an IoT system that monitors air quality
and displays data on a cloud dashboard.

## Description
This project uses an MQ gas sensor to measure air
pollution levels. The data is processed using
Arduino and alerts are generated for poor air quality.

## Features
- Real-time air quality monitoring
- Pollution alert system
- Cloud-based data visualization

## Working
- Gas sensor detects pollution levels
- Arduino processes sensor data
- Data displayed on cloud dashboard

## Conclusion
This system helps monitor environmental air quality
and supports pollution awareness using IoT.
